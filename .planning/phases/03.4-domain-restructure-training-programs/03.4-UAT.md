## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Load Program in Editor
expected: Navigate to Programs, open an existing program. Grid displays correctly with weeks as columns, sessions as row groups, exercises with prescriptions.
result: pass

### 2. Edit Prescription Cell
expected: Click a prescription cell, type "3x10@80%", see the Save button become enabled (dirty state). Cell shows the parsed notation.
result: pass

### 3. Save and Persist Changes
expected: Click "Guardar" button. Button shows loading, then success. Refresh the page - the saved prescription appears correctly.
result: issue
reported: "It saves, but in the cell instead of appearing 3x10@100kg it shows 3x10@100null"
severity: major

### 4. Add Week
expected: Click "+" to add a week column. New week appears. Save and refresh - week persists.
result: pass

### 5. Add Session
expected: Click "Agregar sesion". New session row group appears. Save and refresh - session persists.
result: pass

### 6. Add Exercise to Session
expected: Click "+ Agregar ejercicio" in a session. Exercise combobox appears. Select an exercise. Save and refresh - exercise persists.
result: pass

### 7. Superset Grouping Persists
expected: Right-click an exercise, create or join a superset. See grouped labeling (A1, A2). Save and refresh - superset grouping persists.
result: issue
reported: "Same error as all phases. I have A1 and B1, i click B1 add to superset A, and nothing happens. B1 just turns blue. And if i save nothing persists. User requests simpler UX: just a button 'Agrupar arriba' that moves exercise to group above instead of complex menu."
severity: major

### 8. No Console Errors
expected: Throughout all testing, browser console shows no red errors related to program loading, editing, or saving.
result: issue
reported: "Base UI: A component that acts as a button was not rendered as a native <button>, which does not match the default. Ensure that the element passed to the `render` prop of the component is a real <button>, or set the `nativeButton` prop on the component to `false`."
severity: minor
