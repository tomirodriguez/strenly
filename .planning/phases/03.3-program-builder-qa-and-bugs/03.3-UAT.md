## Gaps

- truth: "Superset menu creates/joins groups with correct labeling"
  status: failed
  reason: "Multiple fix attempts (plans 03, 05, 06) failed to resolve"
  severity: blocker
  deferred_to: Phase 3.4

- truth: "Exercise combobox search is debounced"
  status: failed
  reason: "Debounce implementation not working"
  severity: minor
  deferred_to: Phase 3.4

## Phase Outcome

Phase 3.3 achieved most goals but two issues remain unresolved after 4+ revision cycles:
1. **Superset grouping** - Group labels and menu not working correctly
2. **Exercise search debounce** - API calls not debounced

Decision: Create Phase 3.4 with clean context to address these issues properly.
