## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Edit Mode Triggers - Digit Keys
expected: Press digit (0-9) on selected cell enters edit mode with digit as first char, cursor at end
result: pass

### 2. Edit Mode Triggers - Enter/F2
expected: Press Enter or F2 on selected cell enters edit mode with existing content, cursor at end (not all text selected)
result: pass

### 3. Edit Mode Triggers - Other Keys Ignored
expected: Press letter keys (a-z) on selected cell does NOT enter edit mode - cell stays selected but not editable
result: pass

### 4. Arrow Keys in Edit Mode - Cursor Movement
expected: While editing a cell with text, left/right arrow keys move cursor within the input text (not to adjacent cells)
result: issue
reported: "On edit mode, if I press the arrows (left/right/up/down) it changes the cell. It doesnt navigate in the input"
severity: major

### 5. Arrow Keys at Boundaries
expected: When cursor is at start of input, left arrow navigates to previous cell. When at end, right arrow navigates to next cell.
result: skipped
reason: Depends on Test 4 (cursor movement within input) which failed

### 6. Add Exercise - Local State
expected: Click "+ Agregar ejercicio" row, select an exercise from combobox. The exercise appears immediately in the grid without page refresh. The save button shows unsaved changes.
result: pass
note: Minor feedback - combobox has no debounce

### 7. Superset Menu - Create New Group
expected: Open row actions menu (three dots) on an exercise row. Submenu "Superserie" shows option to create new superset with next available letter (e.g., "Crear superserie [B]")
result: issue
reported: "If i click on C1 I only get 'Crear superserie A'. Superset should link to existing group not create new structure. Also keeps triggering backend API, should be client-side only."
severity: major

### 8. Superset Menu - Join Existing Group
expected: When other superset groups exist in the same session, the Superserie submenu shows options like "Agregar a superserie [A]" to join existing groups
result: skipped
reason: Can't create supersets - update endpoint fails with FK constraint error (group_id not in exercise_groups table)

### 9. Create Program Form - Sessions Count
expected: When creating a new program, the form shows a "Sesiones por semana" field (1-7) alongside weeks field in a compact layout. Default value is 3.
result: pass

### 10. Create Program - Sessions Created
expected: Create a program with sessionsCount=4. The grid shows 4 sessions (Dia 1, Dia 2, Dia 3, Dia 4) for each week.
result: pass
