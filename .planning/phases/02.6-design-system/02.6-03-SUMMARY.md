# Phase 2.6 Plan 03: Sidebar Active Nav Styling Summary

**Blue-600 primary color for active nav items with muted gray for inactive, removing TanStack Router style conflicts**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-25
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Active nav items now have blue-600 (sidebar-primary) background instead of slate-800
- Inactive nav items display with muted gray text (text-muted-foreground)
- Removed conflicting [&.active] classes from TanStack Router Links
- Active state controlled entirely by isActive prop and data-active CSS attribute

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update SidebarMenuButton Active State Styling** - `97ac3c9` (style)
2. **Task 2: Verify Nav Item Styling in AppSidebar** - `1457179` (refactor)
3. **Task 3: Add Nav Item Hover and Focus Polish** - `0982749` (style)

## Files Created/Modified

- `apps/coach-web/src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx` - Updated sidebarMenuButtonVariants to use data-active:bg-sidebar-primary
- `apps/coach-web/src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx` - Removed redundant active classes, added text-muted-foreground for inactive state

## Decisions Made

- **data-active:bg-sidebar-primary for active state** - Uses the sidebar-primary CSS variable (blue-600) for prominent active indication
- **Remove [&.active] TanStack Router classes** - Prevents style conflicts between router active class and sidebar data-active attribute
- **text-muted-foreground for inactive items** - Provides visual hierarchy with gray inactive text that brightens on hover/active

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Sidebar active nav styling complete with proper visual hierarchy
- Ready for 02.6-04 (Design System Documentation) or Phase 3 (Program Builder)
- Visual refresh provides professional dark theme appearance
