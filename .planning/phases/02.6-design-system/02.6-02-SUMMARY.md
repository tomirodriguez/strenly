# Phase 2.6 Plan 02: Layout Components Update Summary

**AppSidebar with logo/nav/settings/user footer, new AppHeader with breadcrumb/icons/CTA slot**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-25T14:04:50Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25T14:09:50Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Updated AppSidebar with logo (ZapIcon + Treino brand), main nav, settings section with divider, and user profile footer with dropdown menu
- Created new AppHeader component with sticky positioning, breadcrumbs, search/notification icons, and optional primary action slot
- Integrated AppHeader into AppShell, removing inline header and UserMenu from header (now in sidebar)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update AppSidebar** - Pre-existing (structure already correct from prior commits)
2. **Task 2: Create AppHeader component** - `1cfe883` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Update AppShell** - Pre-existing (updated in 02.6-01 bug fix)

**Note:** Tasks 1 and 3 were partially completed as a side effect of 02.6-01 bug fix that added user prop passing. Task 2 (AppHeader creation) is the net new work from this plan.

## Files Created/Modified
- `apps/coach-web/src/components/layout/app-header.tsx` - New header component with breadcrumb, icons, CTA slot
- `apps/coach-web/src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx` - Logo header, nav groups, settings section, user footer
- `apps/coach-web/src/components/layout/app-shell.tsx` - Uses AppHeader, passes user to AppSidebar

## Decisions Made
- Move user menu from header to sidebar footer to match reference design (more consistent with modern app patterns)
- Use ZapIcon from lucide-react for logo (placeholder until custom brand icon)
- Add Programs and Templates nav items even though routes don't exist yet (ready for Phase 3)
- Settings section uses uppercase label divider pattern from reference design

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as written. Some work was pre-completed by 02.6-01 due to bug fix cascading changes.

## Issues Encountered
None - all components already in correct state, only needed AppHeader creation.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Layout structure matches reference design
- Ready for 02.6-03 (header/sidebar polish with shadow, active states)
- primaryAction slot available for page-specific CTAs in Phase 3
