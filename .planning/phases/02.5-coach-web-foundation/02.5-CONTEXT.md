# Phase 2.5: Coach Web Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Frontend UI for the coach web app: authentication flows, athlete management, and exercise browsing. This phase catches up the frontend to use the backend built in Phases 1-2. No new backend capabilities.

## Implementation Decisions

### Auth Flow UI
- Split-screen layout: form on one side, logo + tagline on the other
- OAuth first: Google button prominent at top, email/password below with "or" divider
- Onboarding flow: Auth → Plan selection → Organization creation (multi-step wizard allowed)
- "Remember me" checkbox visible on login
- Button spinner for loading states during auth actions

### Athlete List & Forms
- Data table layout with columns: Name, email, status, invitation status, created date
- Live search (debounced) for filtering athletes
- Status badge for invitation state (Pending, Accepted, Expired, Not invited)
- Copy-to-clipboard for invitation links with toast confirmation
- Archived athletes hidden by default (toggle/filter to show)
- Dropdown menu (three-dot) for row actions (edit, archive, invite)
- Bulk actions with checkbox selection (multi-select for archive/invite)
- Classic pagination with page numbers and items-per-page selector

### Exercise Browser
- Data table layout (consistent with athlete list)
- Standard row content: Name, all muscles (badges), movement pattern, curated/custom badge
- Badge indicator distinguishing curated vs custom exercises

### App Shell & Navigation
- Collapsible sidebar (left) that remembers state in localStorage
- Minimal top bar: breadcrumbs only + user menu
- Desktop-only (optimized for 1024px+, no mobile support)
- Feature-only nav items: Dashboard, Athletes, Exercises
- Dashboard shows athlete summary: total athletes, pending invitations, recent activity
- User settings (profile, password) accessible via user menu dropdown
- Theme toggle: user choice between dark/light, default to system preference
- Toast notifications via shadcn Sonner (position: Claude's discretion based on UX)
- Breadcrumbs only for navigation (no large page titles)

### Frontend Architecture
- Thin route files: routes only define config, import page components from features/
- Feature folders organized by domain: features/athletes/, features/exercises/
- Within features: views/ subfolder, each view has components/hooks/utils if view-specific
- Shared feature code at feature root, global code at app root
- Query/mutation hooks inside features: hooks/queries/, hooks/mutations/
- Form schemas: always import from @strenly/contracts, pick/omit as needed locally
- State management: Context for infrequent globals, Zustand for UI/complex forms, TanStack Query for server state
- oRPC client usage per /orpc-query skill pattern

### Claude's Discretion
- Password reset UI approach (inline vs separate page vs modal)
- Auth error display style (inline, toast, or banner)
- Form approach for athlete create/edit (drawer vs modal vs page) based on field count research
- Row click behavior on athlete table (research best UX practice)
- Post-create navigation (research best UX practice)
- Filter UI for exercises (sidebar vs dropdown vs chips - research best UX)
- Organization switcher placement (research best UX)
- Loading states pattern (skeletons vs spinners)
- Error boundary granularity
- Toast position

## Specific Ideas

- Auth branding panel: logo + tagline, clean minimal aesthetic
- Athlete table should feel professional and data-dense like a proper SaaS tool
- Exercise browser consistent with athlete list (both data tables)
- Dashboard as landing page with quick summary stats
