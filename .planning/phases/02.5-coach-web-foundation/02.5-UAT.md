## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Sign Up Flow
expected: Navigate to /signup. Create account with name/email/password. After signup, complete onboarding by creating organization. End up at /dashboard.
result: issue
reported: "I could create the account, no onboarding appear. It just redirects me to the dashboard. Also saw bunch of internal errors: POST /rpc/athletes/list 500 Internal Server Error. Another thing is that the sign up form and login form dont use zod or hookform as the skill explicitly says. That was mandatory."
severity: blocker

### 2. Login Flow
expected: Navigate to /login. Enter email and password. After login, redirect to /dashboard (if organization exists) or /onboarding (if no organization).
result: issue
reported: "Can't log out. Clicking the chip causes error: Base UI MenuGroupRootContext is missing. Menu group parts must be used within <Menu.Group>. Forms still don't follow /form skill pattern based on shadcn React Hook Form."
severity: blocker

### 3. Dashboard Stats
expected: Dashboard shows three stat cards: Total Athletes, Active Athletes, and Pending Invitations with actual counts from your data.
result: issue
reported: "Shows the three cards, but the queries throw Internal Server Error so they have no data"
severity: major

### 4. Dashboard Quick Actions
expected: Dashboard has "Manage Athletes" and "Browse Exercises" links that navigate to /athletes and /exercises respectively.
result: issue
reported: "Manage Athletes redirects good. Browse Exercises navigates but exercises page crashes: Error: DataTable components must be used within DataTable.Root"
severity: blocker

### 5. Theme Toggle
expected: Click user menu (avatar in top bar). Select Theme submenu. Toggle between Light, Dark, and System modes. Theme changes immediately and persists after page refresh.
result: issue
reported: "No place to toggle the theme - feature is missing"
severity: major

### 6. Sidebar Navigation
expected: Sidebar shows Dashboard, Athletes, Exercises navigation items. Clicking each navigates to the correct page. Active item is highlighted. Sidebar can be collapsed with Cmd/Ctrl+B.
result: pass

### 7. Athletes List
expected: /athletes shows a table with athlete names, emails, status, and invitation status. Search input filters athletes by name/email. Pagination works at bottom.
result: issue
reported: "Doesn't work - get error 500 when fetching"
severity: blocker

### 8. Create Athlete
expected: Click "Add Athlete" button. Drawer opens with form (name, email, phone, birthdate, gender, notes). Fill and submit. New athlete appears in list. Success toast shown.
result: issue
reported: "Drawer styling bad - no side padding, footer not at bottom, body should be scrollable. Error messages show default Zod text like 'String must contain at least 1 character(s)'. Email marked optional but validation requires it. Can't save - 500 error with 'Organization no encontrada', error mapping wrong (shouldn't be 500)."
severity: blocker

### 9. Archive Athlete
expected: Click three-dot menu on an athlete row. Select Archive. Confirmation dialog appears. Confirm. Athlete disappears from list (or shows as inactive with "Show archived" toggle).
result: skipped
reason: Can't test - athletes endpoint returns 500 errors

### 10. Generate Invitation
expected: Click three-dot menu on an athlete row. Select "Generate Invite". Success toast confirms link copied to clipboard. You can paste the link.
result: skipped
reason: Can't test - can't create athletes due to 500 errors

### 11. Exercises Browser
expected: /exercises shows a table of exercises with Name, Muscles, Pattern, Type columns. Muscle badges show primary (solid) and secondary (outline) muscles.
result: issue
reported: "Exercises table doesn't work - crashes with DataTable.Root context error (same as test 4)"
severity: blocker

### 12. Exercises Filters
expected: Muscle group dropdown filters exercises by selected muscle. Movement pattern dropdown filters by pattern. Search filters by exercise name. Filters can be combined.
result: skipped
reason: Can't test - exercises table crashes with DataTable.Root error

### 13. Logout
expected: Click user menu. Select Logout. Redirected to /login page. Cannot access /dashboard without logging in again.
result: issue
reported: "User chip not working - can't access user menu (same MenuGroupRootContext error as test 2)"
severity: blocker
