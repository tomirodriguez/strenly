# Phase 4.1: Workout Logging UX Fix - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Fix the workout logging frontend flow. The backend (domain, repository, use cases, procedures) from Phase 4 is correct. The problem is the frontend UX doesn't match how a coach would actually work.

**Current broken flow:**
- Sidebar "Registro" → Pending workouts dashboard (concept doesn't make sense)
- Click "Registrar" → URL is correct but shows Athletes page (route not rendering)

**Correct flow (per 04-CONTEXT.md):**
- Atletas → Click athlete → Athlete Detail Page
- See athlete info + their active program
- Click on a session → Session logging view

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### Athlete Detail Page (NEW)
- Route: `/$orgSlug/athletes/$athleteId`
- Shows athlete info header (name, email, status)
- Shows their assigned program (if any) with expandable weeks/sessions
- Each session row has "Registrar" button to log that session
- Quick access to log history

### Remove "Pending Workouts" Concept
- The "Registro" sidebar item removed or repurposed
- "Pending" has no meaning without scheduled dates
- Coaches work athlete-by-athlete, not from a global queue

### Session Logging Route Fix
- Route `/athletes/$athleteId/log/$sessionId` must render SessionLoggingView
- Currently broken - investigate and fix TanStack Router config

### Log History Access
- From athlete detail page: "Ver Historial" button/link
- Shows past logs for that athlete only

### Navigation Flow
```
Athletes List → Athlete Detail → Program Sessions → Log Session
                     ↓
              Log History (per athlete)
```

</decisions>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Week-based scheduling (assign dates to sessions) - future feature
- Global "today's workouts" dashboard - requires scheduling first
- Batch logging multiple athletes at once

</deferred>
