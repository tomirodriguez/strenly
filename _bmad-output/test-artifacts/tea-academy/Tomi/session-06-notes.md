# Session 6: Quality & Trace - Session Notes

**Learner:** Tomi (Dev)
**Completed:** 2026-02-16
**Score:** 100/100
**Duration:** 45 min

---

## Session Objectives

- Learn Test Review workflow (quality scoring)
- Understand 5 dimensions of test quality
- Master Trace workflow (requirements traceability)
- Apply release gate decisions

---

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Test Review Workflow:** Audit test quality with 0-100 scoring across 5 dimensions
2. **5 Quality Dimensions:** Determinism, Isolation, Assertions, Structure, Performance
3. **Trace Workflow:** Load context → Discover tests → Map criteria → Analyze gaps → Gate decision
4. **Release Gate Logic:** GREEN (all P0/P1 covered), YELLOW (P1 gaps, assess risk), RED (P0 gaps, block)
5. **Quality Metrics:** Track P0/P1 coverage %, flakiness rate, execution time, determinism score
6. **Vanity Metrics:** Don't rely on total line coverage %, test count, or file count

## Quiz Results

**Score:** 100/100

### Questions & Answers

1. What are the 5 dimensions in Test Review? → B - Determinism, Isolation, Assertions, Structure, Performance (correct)
2. When should Trace gate be RED? → B - P0 gaps exist, critical requirements not tested (correct)
3. Which metric matters most? → C - P0/P1 coverage % (correct)

## Key Takeaways

- Test Review scores quality across 5 dimensions (not just "does it pass?")
- Use 5 dimensions as a checklist when reviewing AI-generated tests
- Trace workflow maps tests to requirements and identifies coverage gaps
- Release gate: GREEN/YELLOW/RED based on P0/P1 coverage, not total coverage
- Track meaningful metrics: P0/P1 coverage, flakiness rate, execution time
- Vanity metrics (total coverage %, test count) don't reflect actual quality
- AI-generated tests often score well on Structure but poorly on Determinism and Isolation
