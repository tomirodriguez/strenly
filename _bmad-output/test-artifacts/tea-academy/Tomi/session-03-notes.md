# Session 3: Architecture & Patterns - Session Notes

**Learner:** Tomi (Dev)
**Completed:** 2026-02-16
**Score:** 100/100
**Duration:** 60 min

---

## Session Objectives

- Understand fixture architecture and composition
- Learn network-first patterns
- Master data factories and test setup
- Explore step-file architecture

---

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Fixture Architecture:** Composable fixtures eliminate boilerplate, provide DRY setup/teardown, automatic cleanup, and TypeScript support
2. **Network-First Patterns:** Intercept network BEFORE actions to prevent race conditions, enable deterministic behavior, fast execution, and error scenario control
3. **Data Factories:** Factory functions replace hardcoded test data with overridable, consistent, self-documenting generators
4. **Step-File Architecture:** Micro-file design with just-in-time loading, sequential enforcement, state tracking, and resumable workflows

**Score:** 100/100

### Questions & Answers

1. Main benefit of fixture composition? → B - DRY, define once reuse everywhere (correct)
2. Why network-first over mocking after action? → B - Prevents race conditions (correct)
3. What pattern does this workflow use? → C - Step-File Architecture (correct)

---

## Key Takeaways

- Fixtures are like dependency injection for tests - compose complex from simple
- Network-first: always mock BEFORE the action that triggers the request
- Data factories eliminate hardcoded test data and centralize changes
- Step-file architecture enables disciplined, resumable, maintainable workflows
- Playwright evaluates routes in LIFO order (last registered, first evaluated)
