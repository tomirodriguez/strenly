# Session 5: ATDD & Automate - Session Notes

**Learner:** Tomi (Dev)
**Completed:** 2026-02-16
**Score:** 100/100
**Duration:** 60 min

---

## Session Objectives

- Learn ATDD workflow (failing tests first)
- Understand Automate workflow (expand coverage)
- Master Component TDD red-green loop
- Apply API testing patterns

---

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **ATDD Workflow:** Preflight → Test Strategy → Generate FAILING tests (red) → Implement code (green)
2. **Automate Workflow:** Identify targets → Generate tests → Review & run (tests should pass, code exists)
3. **ATDD vs Automate:** ATDD = tests first, then code. Automate = code first, then tests
4. **Component TDD:** Red (failing test) → Green (minimal code) → Refactor → Repeat
5. **API Testing:** Pure API tests without browser - fast, test business logic directly, validate schemas

### Questions & Answers

1. What is the 'red' phase in TDD? → A - Tests fail, code doesn't exist yet (correct)
2. Difference between ATDD and Automate? → B - ATDD writes tests first, Automate tests existing code (correct)
3. Why pure API tests without browser? → C - Faster and test business logic directly (correct)

---

## Key Takeaways

- ATDD inverts the typical flow: write failing tests FIRST, then implement
- Automate expands coverage for existing code with structured strategy (not random test generation)
- Component TDD loop: Red → Green → Refactor → Repeat
- API tests are fast and ideal for testing business logic (procedures, use cases) without browser overhead
- When working with AI: define expected behavior as tests first, then let AI implement until tests pass
- Domain entities are perfect candidates for component TDD
