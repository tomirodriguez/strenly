# Session 2: Core Concepts - Session Notes

**Learner:** Tomi (Dev)
**Completed:** 2026-02-16
**Score:** 100/100
**Duration:** 45 min

---

## Session Objectives

- Understand testing as engineering philosophy
- Learn risk-based testing with P0-P3 matrix
- Master TEA Definition of Done (quality standards)
- Understand Probability x Impact risk scoring

---

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Testing as Engineering:** Tests are designed before written, maintained like production code, decisions are risk-based
2. **Risk-Based Testing (P0-P3):** P0=Critical (login, payments), P1=High (core workflows), P2=Medium (secondary), P3=Low (tooltips)
3. **Risk Formula:** Risk = Probability x Impact
4. **Definition of Done:** No flaky tests, no hard waits, stateless & parallelizable, self-cleaning, low maintenance
5. **Quality Standards:** Engineering rigor, not perfectionism - builds trust in CI/CD

## Quiz Results

**Score:** 100/100

### Questions & Answers

1. In P0-P3 matrix, what priority for login/authentication? → D - P0 Critical (correct)
2. Problem with sleep(5000) vs waitFor? → B - Hard wait that doesn't react to state (correct)
3. What does "self-cleaning tests" mean? → B - Tests delete/deactivate entities they create (correct)

## Key Takeaways

- Testing is engineering: design before write, maintain like production code
- P0-P3 matrix prioritizes test coverage by risk (Probability x Impact)
- Definition of Done ensures deterministic, stateless, self-cleaning tests
- Quality standards prevent test maintenance nightmares
- When using AI for test generation, provide risk context and enforce DoD standards
