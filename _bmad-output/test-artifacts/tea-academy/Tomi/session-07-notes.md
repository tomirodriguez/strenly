# Session 7: Advanced Patterns - Session Notes

**Learner:** Tomi (Dev)
**Completed:** 2026-02-16
**Score:** 100/100 (completion-based)
**Duration:** Ongoing exploration

## Session Objectives

- Explore TEA knowledge fragments by category
- Deep-dive into selected advanced topics
- Build reference knowledge for future use

---

## Fragments Explored (4 of 35)

### 1. fixture-architecture.md - Composable Fixture Patterns
- Single responsibility: one fixture, one job
- Composition over inheritance with mergeTests
- Automatic cleanup after use()
- Dependency injection: fixtures depend on other fixtures, Playwright resolves the graph

### 2. fixtures-composition.md - mergeTests Composition
- Modularize fixtures by domain (auth, program, athlete)
- Compose only what each test needs
- LIFO conflict resolution (last module wins)
- Layered composition: base → auth → domain

### 3. network-first.md - Network Interception Safeguards
- Golden rule: ALWAYS mock BEFORE the action
- LIFO route evaluation order (register catch-all first, specific after)
- Patterns: static mock, conditional mock, request validation, error simulation, spy
- Cleanup with page.unrouteAll() between tests

### 4. data-factories.md - Data Seeding & Setup
- Factory functions with defaults and overrides
- Named constructors for semantic states (ProgramFactory.draft(), .published())
- Factories for related data (createProgramWithExercises)
- API response factories matching oRPC wire format

## Key Takeaways

- Fixtures are dependency injection for tests - compose simple fixtures into complex setups
- Network-first eliminates race conditions - always mock before the action triggers
- Data factories centralize test data - one place to update when schema changes
- These 4 patterns combined form the foundation of a maintainable E2E test suite
- Can return to Session 7 anytime to explore remaining 31 fragments
