# Session 4: Test Design - Session Notes

**Learner:** Tomi (Dev)
**Completed:** 2026-02-16
**Score:** 100/100
**Duration:** 60 min

---

## Session Objectives

- Learn the Test Design workflow
- Understand risk/testability assessment
- Master coverage planning with test levels
- Apply the test priorities matrix

---

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Test Design Workflow:** Load context → Risk assessment → Coverage planning → Generate test design document
2. **Risk Scoring:** Risk = Probability x Impact. Score both as Low/Medium/High to determine P0-P3 priority
3. **Testability Assessment:** Can we test this easily? Dependencies? Infrastructure needed?
4. **Test Levels:** Unit (isolated), Integration (multi-component), E2E (full workflows)
5. **Coverage Strategy:** P0=Unit+Integration+E2E, P1=Integration+E2E, P2=E2E/Integration, P3=Manual/skip
6. **Test Priorities Matrix:** Coverage targets - 100% P0, 80% P1, 50% P2, 20% P3

## Quiz Results

**Score:** 100/100

### Questions & Answers

1. What does Test Design workflow help you do? → B - Plan tests BEFORE writing them (correct)
2. How do you calculate risk? → B - Probability x Impact (correct)
3. For P0 features, which test levels? → C - Unit + Integration + E2E (correct)

---

## Key Takeaways

- Plan tests before writing them - design before code
- Risk = Probability x Impact determines P0-P3 priority
- Different priority levels need different test coverage levels
- P0 features need comprehensive coverage (Unit + Integration + E2E)
- When using AI for test generation, provide risk context and specify test levels needed
- Test Design Documents serve as blueprints that guide both human and AI test creation
