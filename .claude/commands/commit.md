# Professional Commit

Create a commit following Conventional Commits specification by analyzing the actual changes.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze changes** by running:
   - `git status` to see modified/added/deleted files
   - `git diff --staged` for staged changes
   - `git diff` for unstaged changes
   - `git log --oneline -5` to understand recent commit style

2. **Determine commit type** based on changes:
   - `feat`: New feature or capability
   - `fix`: Bug fix
   - `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior change
   - `docs`: Documentation only
   - `test`: Adding or updating tests
   - `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependencies
   - `style`: Formatting, whitespace (no logic change)
   - `perf`: Performance improvement

3. **Identify scope** from the primary area affected (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `core`)

4. **Write commit message**:
   - Subject: `type(scope): concise description` (max 72 chars, imperative mood)
   - Body (if needed): Explain **why**, not what (the diff shows what)
   - Keep it professional and concise

5. **Stage and commit**:
   - Stage relevant files with `git add`
   - Create commit with the message
   - Show the result with `git log -1`

## Rules

- NEVER add "Co-Authored-By", "Generated by", or any AI attribution
- NEVER include obvious information the diff already shows
- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Be specific: "fix null check in auth middleware" not "fix bug"
- Group related changes into one commit when they serve one purpose
